diagnostics.css
===============

A set of utility styles useful for debugging and diagnosing CSS. Includes classes that provide visual feedback allowing you to quickly see how styles are affecting the size, position, etc. of elements on the page.

Inspired by [a tip](http://csswizardry.com/web-design+/#css-2) in Harry Robert's publication, [Web Design+](http://csswizardry.com/web-design+/). This is my take on a diagnostic stylesheet.
